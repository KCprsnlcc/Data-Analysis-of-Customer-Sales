The Data Analysis page for PilarEase enables users to conduct an in-depth examination of their data through a structured, interactive interface. Users can begin by uploading a CSV file containing their data, which is then processed to display key features. The data preview shows paginated entries, with a search function allowing users to filter results based on specific terms. 

The first step, *Loading the Data*, presents an initial overview of data rows and columns, including details like `Customer_ID`, `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Amount_Spent`. Next, the *Inspecting Data Types and Missing Values* section provides a summary of each columnâ€™s data type and identifies any missing values. The system also performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*, displaying insights like total expenditure by product category through a bar chart.

For further analysis, a *Detailed EDA* section includes a correlation matrix to reveal relationships among numeric data and a trend line that illustrates spending trends over time. Finally, the *Reporting Insights* section summarizes key metrics, such as the total number of customers, average age, total and average amount spent, and the most popular product category. These insights are complemented by options to export the analysis in Excel or PDF formats for further use.
